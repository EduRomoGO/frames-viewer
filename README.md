## Comments

I have added a button for retrying specific failures, so there is no need to reload the page until both endpoints work at the same time


For sake of simplicity I have just put buttons instead of the little boxes
Also its style is generic too

Areas of improvement 
  - better styling
  - toast to indicate copied text to the clipboard
  - better recursion
  - tests
  - better code organization
  - Make custom data fetching hook more generic

There are also some comments spread through the code
